# Grammy Application
A app where you can play any song that won a grammy award , I just started off with 3 songs to make it simple.
When you open the page you will have songs to select from 
When you click select the video of the grammy award winning song should play

## github steps
GitHub Steps

'git status' - gives you the status of all the files in your local repo
'git add <filename>' (use '.' to add all files) - add all of your files to staging
'git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE GOES HERE" -> Adds a message to your commit
'git push' -> pushes code from your local repo to your remote repo (local=your computer, remote=github)

** If it is your first time pushing to the remote repository then you will need to do a 'git push -u origin <branch_name>'
