# Grammy Award Winning Songs Application
is a simple React app that displays a list of Grammy Award-winning songs and allows users to select and play a song. When a song is selected, it is displayed in the SongPlayer component
# features
It shows a list of the following grammy winner song ( Songlist component) I just started with 3 songs to make it simple
It lets you select which song you want to play
the selected song it played in the SongPlayer component
It demonstrates the use of React hooks (useState) to manage the state of the currently selected song.
# components
I have songlist and songplayer and the main components on this project
app.css is used to style my application
# to use
First you open the app, you will have songs to select that only have won a grammy, , you click select and a video , should auto play and enjoy!
I wanted to start with something simple and not to complicated but hopefully over time I can add more songs to my app and application make more interactive features on the application

SinceI was having issues to pushing my code to my repo I added my steps below
## github steps
GitHub Steps

'git status' - gives you the status of all the files in your local repo
'git add <filename>' (use '.' to add all files) - add all of your files to staging
'git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE GOES HERE" -> Adds a message to your commit
'git push' -> pushes code from your local repo to your remote repo (local=your computer, remote=github)

** If it is your first time pushing to the remote repository then you will need to do a 'git push -u origin <branch_name>'
